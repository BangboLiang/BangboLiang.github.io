# Back to my website

It's been almost one year since I post my new contents for my website.
This several month I have walked through a lot, have different feelings, works, friends, goals, and so on. Deeply gaining a lot of experience.

A couple of weeks before, I met an impressive taxi driver. He put a notebook on the back seats, with a pencil. When I saw the first page, it says, just write down everything you want, happiness to share, sadness to compain, wishes to make... And when I get to the next page, the third page, forth to the 100th page, each page has several words wrote down by different guests, and down the each message there is more or less paragraph wrote down by a red pencil, from the taxi driver I guess.

From those messages, I saw the different lifes of different men, someone is struggling for an important examination, someone is feeling sad for a loved one, someone is enjoying his/her new acquisition, and someone is sharing his/her happiness. I think we do have a different life, but we have similar emotions and experiences, everyone has his or her own value, billions of people make up the whole world.

Still have some article to share.

> _I believe that people who seek death and life every day do not seek death with all their heart. People who really want to die will not seek death and life. These people are not looking forward to death, but longing for love._

This one really shocked me.

> _For the hometown, I suddenly have a new understanding: people's hometown, and not just a specific piece of land, but a vast and incomparable mood, not subject to the limitations of space and time; this mood once aroused, is that you have returned to the hometown!_

My feelings about my hometown is totally the same with that.

> _And regard the suspicious eyes of others as a ghostly flame, and boldly go your own way._

This one for all of you.
