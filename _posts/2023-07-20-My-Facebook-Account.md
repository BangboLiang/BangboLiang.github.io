After rethinking the different and various social platforms for days, I decided to reuse my Facebook account to share something with myself.

You can follow me [here!](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100083663814660)

I think I have a lot of things to share include but not limited to study outcomes, photography, music(especially classical music), my random essay, video games(the less, the better) and so on.

From now on, I use Twitter(best but too many adults content, I don't know how many sh\*t are there in Elon Musk's mind), Instagram(mainly for picture sharing), and Facebook.
