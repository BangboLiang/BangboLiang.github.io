When I begin to write some of my random essays, what comes to my mind first is that the words from Shakespeare: 
>_To be or not to be? That is a question._

Maybe I can not understand Hamlet's state of mind at that time, but everytime I read these words,
they make me feel powerfull.

Another words I'd like to share today is from a Chinese author named Shi Tiesheng:
>_But the sun, he is both setting and rising every moment. When he walked downthe mountains to collect the desolate afterglow, it was the time he climbed up other mountains and burning on the other side to spread the blazing glow._
>_On that day, I will walk down the mountain in silence, leaning on my crutches, too._
>_But one day, in a certain valley, a romping child is bound to run up, holding his toy._
>_Of course, that's not me._
>_But, isn't that me?_

I love Shi Tiesheng's opinion about **life and death**. Everytime I read his book **_Me and Altar_**, something beyound the word comes to my mind, it feels strong and warm. Just like there's a sun in his book, in his words, and finnaly, it come into my heart and a warm current circulates through in my whole body.

The last words today is from Shi Tiesheng, too:
>_No matter how much you're disappointed in the opposite sex, you have no reason to be disappointed in love. Beause love itself is hope. Love is your own quality, your own soul, your own situation and has nothing to do with others._

I can not agree more with his opinion about love. Even in nowadays, this kind of thought about love is a encouragement for me.
