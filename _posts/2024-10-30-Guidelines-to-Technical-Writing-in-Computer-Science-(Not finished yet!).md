This guideline is provided by prof. Li, whose website is [here](https://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/likeqin)

After reading this, you're going to know which kind of paper is presentable(not yet publishable).



***1. Write in English directly. Do not write in Chinese, and then translate to English***

This is really important, but really hard for students whose mother tongue is not English, but I think we should try to write in English directly, by this way, we can improve our English level greatly, not only in writing, but also in reading and speaking.



***2. Use Latex. Do not use Word, and the convert to Latex.***

Of course! I think no one will think that using word to write paper is better than using latex. Furthermore, every conference and journal's offical website will give you a latex template, you can use overleaf or other online latex platform to edit it to your own paper. It's quite convenient.



***3. Do not have spelling errors. Use a spelling checker.***

If you don't want your paper to be a joke to other researchers, you should obey this rule.



***4. Do not have grammatical errors.***

***For each sentence, check***

- ***Sentence structure (subject, predicate, object, adverbial);***
- ***singular and plural;***
- ***tense;***
- ***active voice and passive voice;***
- ***clauses.***

***Still have trouble? Consider to use a professional English editing service.***

Grammar is another trouble which make us feeling headache. Just pay attention to it, correct your error day by day, you will have progress.



***5. Choose a proper titile***

Bad example: A decentralized and distributed and privacy-preserving deep learning model for vehicular ad-hoc networks using blockchain and edge computing

(This long title assembles six research areas, without even mentioning the problem to be solved.)

Good example: Hierarchical pooling strategy optimization for accelerating asymptomatic COVID-19 screening.

(In only nine words, the title tells (1) the problem: accelerating; (2) the technique: hierarchical polling strategy; (3) the achievement: optimization; (4) the application: asymptomatic COVID-19 screening.)
