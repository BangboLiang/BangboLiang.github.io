# The White Paper "Full-Stack Technology White Paper on Optical-Electrical Hybrid Switching Networks for Intelligent Computing Centers", Authored by Me, Is Published!

We have jointly released the *Full-Stack Technology White Paper on Optical-Electronic Hybrid Switching Networks for Intelligent Computing Centers* in collaboration with multiple scientific research and industrial institutions. This white paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the technological trends and development paths of optoelectronic-electronic collaborative networks.

**White Paper Compiling Institutions**: Hunan University, China Unicom Research Institute, China Unicom Software Research Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)

### Why Should You Read This White Paper?

Artificial intelligence is reshaping production and daily life at an unprecedented speed. Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models continue to push the boundaries of computing and communication capabilities, driving the in-depth evolution of Intelligent Computing Center (ICC) architectures. However, currently deployed all-electronic switching networks are approaching bottlenecks in terms of bandwidth density, end-to-end latency, and energy efficiency ratio — making network performance a key factor restricting ICC efficiency.

Leveraging its advantages of ultra-large bandwidth, ultra-low latency, and low power consumption, optical switching technology is forming a complementary "optoelectronic-electronic collaborative" architecture with electronic switching, emerging as a critical direction for next-generation ICC networks. Nevertheless, its implementation still requires overcoming multiple technical hurdles, such as protocol stack reconstruction, dynamic scheduling, routing convergence, resource management, and physical layer optimization.

### This White Paper Is Designed to Address These Issues:

It not only systematically sorts out the development background of optoelectronic-electronic collaborative networks but also comprehensively analyzes protocol stack optimization paths, resource scheduling strategies, and future standardization trends. It helps industry researchers, equipment manufacturers, and operators grasp the core direction of technological evolution.

### Key Highlights of the White Paper

✅ Sorts out national policies, AI trends, and new network requirements of ICCs
✅ Analyzes performance differences and complementarity between optical switching and electronic switching
✅ Summarizes key challenges and technical paths from the application layer to the physical layer
✅ Proposes future technological evolution directions and standardization recommendations

We aim for this white paper to provide a systematic reference framework and technical insights for researchers, equipment manufacturers, operators, and service providers in the ICC network field. Together, we can promote the construction of a next-generation ICC network infrastructure featuring ultra-large scale, ultra-large bandwidth, ultra-low latency, and ultra-high reliability.
